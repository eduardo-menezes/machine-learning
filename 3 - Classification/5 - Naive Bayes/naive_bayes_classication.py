''' The bayes theorem tells that da variables must be independent to be applicated,
    but in naive-bayes ML algorithm, it may not be totaly independent to be applicated.
     P(A|X) = P(B|X) * P(A) / P(X), where X is a Feature. P(X) means the likelyhood of
     a random point to fall into a circle area, and this point to have these features
     from theses points in this area. P(x) =  (NÂ° of observations)/ (total observations) '''
